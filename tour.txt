Welcome to Omniref!
===================

Omniref is a tool that allows you to attach notes to the source code in your
git repository. We track the *complete history* of every line of code in your
project, and use that to keep your notes in the right place as your code 
changes.

Let's look at another feature. I've made a change to the line with the note:

**This line changed, but the note stayed in place! Click on the sticky note icon to see what's there!**

When you connect your repository to Omniref, you'll be able to add annotations
to your code in the same way -- markdown-enabled smart notes, attached to a whole
file, or just a single line of code.

To continue with the tour, click on the right-arrow button in the upper-right
corner of this window to jump to the next version of the file.
