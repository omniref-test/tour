Welcome to Omniref!
===================

Omniref is a tool that allows you to attach notes to the source code in your
git repository. We track the *complete history* of every line of code in your
project, and use that to keep your notes in the right place as your code 
changes.

Notes disappear when their target lines are deleted!
----------------------------------------------------

I deleted the line that had the note. It's not shown in this file revision.


Every line has a complete revision history
------------------------------------------

<-- Look at the gutter, to the left of the code. Every line has a git-blame style 
    SHA value, indicating the revision that changed the line. But there's more!
    If you click on the SHA value for any line, you'll see a complete *revision 
    history* for each line. You can follow a line back in time to its origin,
    and see how (and why) it changed.

To continue with the tour, click on the right-arrow button in the upper-right
corner of this window to jump to the next version of the file.
